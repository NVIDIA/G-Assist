pywebview>=4.0.0
# USB Audio support is handled through browser WebRTC APIs
# No additional Python packages needed for USB microphone detection
# All USB-specific logic is implemented in JavaScript within the webview

# IMPORTANT: For microphone support on Windows, you need:
# 1. Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime installed
#    Download: https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/
# 2. OR use a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge) directly
# 
# If you see "microphones are not supported in this browser":
# - Install Edge WebView2 Runtime
# - Restart the application
# - Check that pywebview is using Edge WebView2, not Internet Explorer
#
# DIAGNOSTIC TOOL: Run this to check compatibility:
# python check_webview_compatibility.py
