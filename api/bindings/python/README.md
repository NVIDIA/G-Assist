# 🚀 G-Assist Python Binding

Transform your Python applications into powerful AI-enabled experiences with G-Assist! This binding makes it incredibly easy to integrate G-Assist's capabilities into your Python projects. We've abstracted away the complexity of state machines and callbacks, making everything beautifully synchronous and straightforward.

## ✨ What Can It Do?
- 🤖 Send commands to G-Assist and receive responses with just a few lines of code
- 🔄 Synchronous, blocking calls for easier programming
- 🎯 Simple, clean API that gets out of your way
- 🧩 Easy integration into any Python project

## 📋 Before You Start
Make sure you have:
- Python 3.x installed on your computer
- pip package manager
- G-Assist core services installed on your system

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 1: Install the Package
From the directory where the setup.py exists, run:
```bash
pip install .
```

### Step 2: Basic Usage
Here's all you need to get started:
```python
from rise import rise

# Register your client
rise.register_rise_client()

# Send a command and get response
response = rise.send_rise_command('What is my GPU?')

# Print the response
print(response)
"""
Response: Your GPU is an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 with a Driver version of 572.83.
"""
```

## 💬 Interactive Chat Example

Want to build a more interactive experience? Check out this complete chat application that includes animated thinking bubbles and colored output!

```python
from rise import rise
import time
from colorama import Fore, Style, init  # type: ignore
import sys
import threading

def thinking_bubble(stop_event):
    while not stop_event.is_set():
        for _ in range(3):
            if stop_event.is_set():
                break
            sys.stdout.write('.')
            sys.stdout.flush()
            time.sleep(0.5)
        sys.stdout.write('\b\b\b   \b\b\b')  # Erase the dots

def main():
    rise.register_rise_client()

    while True:
        # Get user input
        user_prompt = input(Fore.CYAN + "ME: " + Style.RESET_ALL)
        stop_event = threading.Event()  # Event to signal the thinking bubble to stop
        thinking_thread = threading.Thread(
            target=thinking_bubble, args=(stop_event,))
        thinking_thread.start()  # Start the thinking dots in a separate thread
        response = rise.send_rise_command(user_prompt)
        stop_event.set()  # Signal the thinking thread to stop
        thinking_thread.join()  # Wait for the thread to finish
        print(Fore.YELLOW + "RISE: " + response)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
