# MCP Stdio Filesystem Plugin — dependencies
#
# The G-Assist SDK (gassist_sdk) is bundled in the libs/ folder and does NOT
# need to be installed via pip.
#
# This plugin requires Node.js (>= 18) and npx, which are used to run the
# official MCP filesystem server package:
#
#   @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem  (Node.js / npm)
#
# No Python packages beyond the bundled SDK are needed.
