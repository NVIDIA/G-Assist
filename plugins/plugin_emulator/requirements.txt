# G-Assist Plugin Emulator Requirements

# Core dependencies (no additional packages needed for basic functionality)
# The emulator uses only Python standard library for core features:
# - subprocess (process management)
# - threading (background reader thread)
# - json (JSON-RPC protocol)
# - struct (message framing)
# - queue (thread-safe communication)
# - pathlib (path handling)

# Optional: Color output for CLI
colorama>=0.4.6

# For autonomous testing mode (LLM judge integration)
# These are required only if using --test command with autonomous mode
openai>=1.0.0

# Note: The LLM judge uses NVIDIA API which is OpenAI-compatible
# Set LLM_API_KEY environment variable with your NVIDIA API key
